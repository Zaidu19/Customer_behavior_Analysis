# Customer_behavior_Analysis
Data Analytics Project Showcasing Customer Behavior Analysis Using Python,SQL And Power BI.

# 🧠 Data Analytics Project

📋 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from data extraction to visualization.
It involves:
Loading and exploring a dataset using Python
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning
Executing SQL queries in PostgreSQL for deeper insights
Building an interactive Power BI Dashboard for visualization and reporting
The goal is to derive meaningful insights and present them in a way that supports data-driven decision-making.

# 🗂️ Dataset

Source: [Mention dataset source or “Public dataset used for analysis.”]
Format: CSV file
Size: ~[18] rows × [3901] columns
Description: Contains information about [briefly describe what the dataset is about — e.g., sales, customers, employees, etc.]

🔍 Steps Followed

1️⃣ Data Loading
Loaded the dataset using Pandas
Inspected structure, column names, and data types
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed missing values, duplicates, and outliers
Computed summary statistics
Visualized distributions and relationships using Matplotlib & Seaborn
3️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handled missing and inconsistent values
Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
Converted data types for analysis consistency
4️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
Imported the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL
Executed SQL queries for data aggregation, joins, and filtering
Derived insights such as top-performing categories, trends, and correlations
5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
Connected PostgreSQL to Power BI
Created interactive charts, KPIs, and filters
Designed a clean, professional dashboard for storytelling

# 📊 Dashboard

The Power BI Dashboard includes:
Overview page with key metrics
Trend analysis and categorical breakdowns
Interactive slicers for user-driven exploration
